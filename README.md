## Install and use

To install and use Quarto extensions the best option is to use `quarto` commands in the shell. To add the **RSE Revealjs template** to an existing directory (project) type the following in the terminal:

```bash
quarto install extension giuliomela/rse_temp@master
```

The alternative, especially suitable in case one is starting a new project from scratch is to use the `quarto use` command, as suggested in the [Quarto official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/starter-templates.html):

```bash
quarto use template giuliomela/rse_temp@master
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your presentation. Enjoy!
